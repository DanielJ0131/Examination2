To do List - Examination 2

Please add onto the list if you want some improvements or have some nice suggestions!

Daniels Suggestions:

1. If you die to Gun, game stops and shows you the "Scoreboard"
and Game Stats. This can be like a leaderboard! "How many wins can you get?"


2. Make Gun Scenario it's own function in Game, because it takes so many code rows in the if else statements.
This can make the code more readable.


3. Make another Game for fun! Maybe Mi can program this one and me + Chris can contribute!


4. Make Players able to import an old Scoreboard with pickle.load and pickle.dump!

Chris Suggestions:
1. Going to make the code better and adding a new feature, like how many rounds to play or wanna play again.
(AND DANIEL DO NOT DO MY SUGGESTION, I wanna try it too :D )
