To do List - Examination 2

Please add onto the list if you want some improvements or have some nice suggestions!

Daniels Suggestions:

1. If you die to Gun, game stops and shows you the "Scoreboard"
and Game Stats. This can be like a leaderboard! "How many wins can you get?"


2. Make Gun Scenario it's own function in Game, because it takes so many code rows in the if else statements.
This can make the code more readable.


3. Make another Game for fun! Maybe Mi can program this one and me + Chris can contribute!


4. Make Players able to import an old Scoreboard with pickle.load and pickle.dump!


5. After reading instructions, be able to "go back"


6. Scoreboard, is it printed after every win / lose / tie or only when we go to "Scoreboard"? 
Maybe we should print it after every game, so we can see how many wins we have accumulated.


7. Make roll the dice a function so that we can unit test it easier!


8. Best of Rounds, Maybe this is always set to 10 so it's easier to play and keep score?
